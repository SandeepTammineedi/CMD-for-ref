#In Ubuntu
#Step 1 - Add Node.js ppa
#The Node.js package is available in the LTS release and the current release. Itâ€™s up to the user to select the version of Node that is required. Run the following command to add the PPA to the Ubuntu system:


curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash - &&\
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

#Step 2 - Install Node.js on Ubuntu
#After successfully adding the PPA to the system, execute the command below to install Node on Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install nodejs


#Step 3 - Verification
#To verify any installation, check the version number of the installed software. For node, run the following command:

node -v 

#If the correct version number is displayed on the terminal, the installation of Node on your system was successful.



Install Modules with npm install

#Installing modules from the npm registry is one of the most basic things
you should learn to do when getting started with npm. As you dive deeper,
you'll begin to learn some variations on installing modules, 
but here's the very core of what you need to know to install
a standalone module into the current directory:

$ npm install

Once you run this, npm will begin installing all of the current project's dependencies

What is npm run build?
$ npm run build 
#npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app.
